# Lilypad Faucet

Use this faucet to drop native tokens (to pay for gas fees) and Lilypad tokens on a private blockchain.

## Local development

Run the following commands `./stack faucet-docker-build` and `./stack faucet-docker-run` and then visit `http://localhost:8082` in your browser to provide an address to receive the tokens.

## Deployment

The faucet should not be deployed more than once, but if needed a manual workflow can be triggered to deploy and start the faucet.
